<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</span> is located on
the crest of the high divide which forms the boundary
between Tennessee and North Carolina. This mountain
range, representing one of the oldest uplands on earth,
zigzags through the park from northeast to southwest for
71 miles, or 54 miles by air line. For 36 miles along its
main crest the range maintains an altitude in excess of 5,000
feet. Sixteen of its peaks rise more than 6,000 feet. The
deep blue haze rising from the valleys to the summits of the
lofty peaks gives these mountains their name.</p>

<p>Renowned for its splendid forests and containing a rich
variety of plant life, the Great Smokies region has long been
regarded by prominent botanists as the cradle of the present
vegetation of eastern America.</p>

<p>Arnold Guyot, eminent scientist whose exploration of the
Appalachian System began a century ago, was the first to
describe the Great Smoky Mountains from personal observation.
He wrote:</p>

<p>“Although the high peaks of the Smoky mountains are
some fifty feet lower than the isolated and almost exceptional
group of the Black mountains, by their number, their magnitude,
the continuity and general elevation of the chains,
and of the base upon which they repose, they are like a
massive and high citadel which is really the culminating
region of all the Appalachian System.”</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="History_of_the_Park">History of the Park</h2>
</div>

<p>Prior to the start of the 20th century, the area now comprising
the park was little known to the outside world,
although DeSoto is believed to have viewed the mountains.
They were, and still are, the home of the Cherokees who now
occupy the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina,
adjacent to the park on the south. The few white settlers
were the rugged mountaineer descendants of colonists from
England and Scotland who lived isolated and primitive lives.
The Great Smokies region became better known during and
subsequent to World War I when logging railroads of
lumber companies penetrated some of its virgin forests.
Still later, highways skirted the area and visitors were able
to view its majestic peaks from a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>The successful movement for the creation of a national
park in this area was begun in 1923, and its establishment
was authorized by the Federal Government by act of Congress
approved May 22, 1926. Enabling acts were passed
by the State legislatures of North Carolina and Tennessee
in 1927, and land acquisition was begun with State funds,
matched by a generous donation made by John D. Rockefeller,
Jr., through the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial,
in honor of his mother. Subsequently, Federal funds were
made available for the completion of the project.</p>

<p>On February 6, 1930, the Governors of North Carolina
and Tennessee presented the Secretary of the Interior with
deeds to an initial 158,876 acres of land on behalf of their
respective States. A limited park was thus established for
administration and protection. The park, now containing
507,168 acres of Federal lands, was formally dedicated on
September 2, 1946.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Pioneer_Culture_in_the_Great_Smokies">Pioneer Culture in the Great Smokies</h2>
</div>


<p>Great Smoky Mountains National Park presents an opportunity
to preserve frontier conditions of a century ago. The
cultural and human interest aspects of this park are exceeded
only by its scenery and natural history.</p>

<p>In places where the forest has not yet encroached upon
them, there are clearings which were the sloping little farms
of the mountain pioneers. Sturdy log structures in varying
stages of disintegration remain there as evidence of a way
of life which has practically disappeared in eastern United
States. Some of these log cabins, barns, and other buildings
have been rehabilitated in place so that you may see the
original structures in their true setting. Most of them are
in Cades Cove, where the park’s only grist mill powered by
an overshot wheel is located. Cades Cove, an isolated,
oval-shaped valley surrounded by mountains, is a region of
outstanding pastoral charm which you should visit.</p>

<p>Some of the finest of various types of authentic pioneer
structures have been assembled in the immediate vicinity
of the Oconaluftee Ranger Station and Pioneer Museum,
located on the cross-mountain highway about 2 miles north
of Cherokee, N. C. On display in the museum are tools,
household objects, and a variety of other handmade items
which were used by the pioneers who made their homes on
lands which now comprise the park. This building is open
from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m., April through October.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Cherokee_Indian_Reservation">The Cherokee Indian Reservation</h2>
</div>


<p>You will be interested in the Cherokee Indians on the
Cherokee Reservation, which is immediately south of the
park. Although the Government has instituted here a
comprehensive system of education and modern methods of
living, ancient ceremonies and sports are preserved as tribal
customs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Forests">Forests</h2>
</div>


<p>Crowning the highest peaks with spruce and fir and
carpeting the mountainsides with a wealth of deciduous
trees is an unbroken forest cover, which cannot be matched
in eastern America. In all of Europe there are not as many
species of native trees as are to be found in Great Smoky
Mountains National Park. A number of these, such as
Canada hemlock, silverbell, red spruce, yellow buckeye, and
mountain-ash grow to record size, while others become
giants of their kind. Approximately 40 percent of the
more than half-million acres which comprise the park are
in the original forested condition. A total of 130 native
tree species are known to grow in this area.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Other_Plant_Life">Other Plant Life</h2>
</div>


<p>Few, if any, areas in the eastern United States possess so
great a variety of plants. Altogether, the tree, shrub, and
herb varieties total more than 1,300. Botanists have also
listed over 1,800 species of fungi, 330 mosses and liverworts,
and 230 lichens. The earliest flowers occasionally
appear by the close of February in lowland areas, while the
witchhazel, latest to bloom, may hold its blossoms into
December. Late April finds the spring flowers, including
the abundant dogwood, at their blossoming peak; May is
best for the mountain laurel; middle June usually finds both
the flame azalea and rose-purple rhododendron at their
finest; middle July is likely to be the peak of the great white
rhododendron’s flowering. Autumn colors are excellent
throughout October, with the height of coloration near the
end of the month.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_Wildlife_Sanctuary">A Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>
</div>


<p>Here, as in all national parks, wildlife is given complete
protection. No hunting or trapping is permitted. Since
establishment of the park, the black bear population has
increased considerably, and such animals as the white-tailed
deer, red and gray foxes, raccoon, bobcat, wild turkey, ruffed
grouse, and others find sanctuary in these mountains. More
than 52 species of fur-bearing animals, some 200 birds, 36
reptiles, 37 amphibians, and 80 fishes are known to live here.</p>

<p><b>The feeding, touching, teasing, or molesting of bears
is prohibited.</b> This regulation is enforced strictly for the
protection of the public. Persons using park trails have
nothing to fear from unmolested bears. If tempted by food,
however, some bears, which frequent sections of the motor
road, become dangerous. They should not be fed or
approached. Persons using the Appalachian Trail shelters
can protect their food supplies by suspending them from
tree limbs outside the shelter.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Fishing">Fishing</h2>
</div>


<p>Approximately 600 miles of streams, many of them well
suited to trout, flow down the slopes of the Great Smoky
Mountains. Each year thousands of hatchery-reared trout
are released in the more heavily fished waters. Rainbow
and brook trout and small-mouth bass lure the devotees of
Izaak Walton. Persons fishing in park waters must have
the State or county license issued and required by North
Carolina, or the State license issued and required by Tennessee,
depending upon the section of the park being fished.
Catches are regulated, and some streams may be found closed
for restocking. The fishing season is from May 16 to
August 31. Current regulations may be obtained from the
office of the superintendent or from park rangers or wardens.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Interpretive_Service">Interpretive Service</h2>
</div>


<p>Beginning in May and continuing for 6 months, a program
of naturalist-guided field trips and talks is available.
This service is maintained by the Government and is free
to the public.</p>

<p>Naturalists meet hikers at designated points in or near
the park and conduct visits to outstanding objectives over
good trails. Plant and animal life is discussed informally
along the way. There are several types of walks ranging
from 2 hours to all day. Illustrated talks are given in the
evenings at regular intervals, chiefly in hotel lobbies and
other points of visitor-concentration.</p>

<p>Programs describing the nature-guide service are available
(May-October) at headquarters and at Oconaluftee Ranger
Station and are posted in hotels and various places throughout
the park.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
</div>


<p>Free modern campgrounds are provided on the Tennessee
side of the park at the Chimney Tops, 6 miles south of
Gatlinburg, and Cades Cove, 7 miles from the Townsend
entrance to the park; on the North Carolina side at Smokemont,
on the transmountain highway, Balsam Mountain,
10 miles from Soco Gap on U. S. 19 (Blue Ridge Parkway
spur), and Deep Creek, 2 miles from Bryson City. Aside
from these campgrounds, the only accommodations in the
park are at Le Conte Lodge on the top of Mount Le Conte,
accessible only by foot or horseback. For reservations and
rates, write Jack Huff, Gatlinburg, Tenn.</p>

<p>A number of hotel and tourist courts are available in
cities and towns near the park, and at Knoxville and Asheville.
Inquiries regarding these accommodations should
be addressed to Knoxville Tourist Bureau, Henley Street,
Knoxville, Tenn.; East Tennessee Automobile Club, Knoxville,
Tenn., Chambers of Commerce of Gatlinburg,
Knoxville, and Maryville, Tenn., Asheville, Waynesville,

</div>


<p>Please note the following requirements which are necessary
for the protection of the natural beauties of the park,
as well as for your comfort and convenience:</p>

<p>The park is a sanctuary for all living things. It is a
violation of the law to destroy, injure, or disturb trees,
shrubs, flowers, birds, animals, or any natural feature in the
park.</p>

<p>The speed limit is 35 miles an hour, unless otherwise
posted. Drive carefully; keep to the right. Report all
accidents to a park ranger.</p>

<p>Camping or lighting fires at places other than designated
campgrounds or picnic areas is not allowed, except by permit.
To camp in remote sections of the park, except during
periods of high fire hazard, permits may be secured at the
office of the superintendent, the Oconaluftee Ranger Station,
or from the district park rangers or wardens. Camping is
restricted to certain periods at the campgrounds. Individual
sites provided with fireplaces and water are available.</p>

<p>Please help to keep the park clean. Do not scatter papers,
picnic remnants, and the like; use trash receptacles along
roads, in picnic areas, and campgrounds.</p>

<p>Fire is one of the greatest dangers to the park. Put out
fires completely upon leaving. Be sure cigarettes and
matches are out before disposal. Lunches may be eaten
along roadsides, but fires should not be built.</p>

<p>Only those persons having special permits may collect
botanical or geological specimens in the park. Such permits
may be secured by competent scientists upon application to
the superintendent.</p>

<p>Dogs and cats are permitted in the park if on leash, crated,
or otherwise under physical restrictive control at all times.</p>

<p>The feeding, touching, teasing, or molesting of bears is
prohibited.</p>

<p>Deliberate infraction of park regulations may bring
penalty of fine or imprisonment or both.</p>

<p>Paved highways from all States converge at Knoxville,
Tenn., and Asheville, N. C. Bus lines maintain service to
both cities. The Southern Railway and the Louisville &amp;
Nashville Railroad serve Knoxville; the former also serves
Asheville. Knoxville may also be reached by American,
Capital (PCA), and Delta Airlines; Asheville, by Capital
(PCA), Delta, and Piedmont Airlines. Trailways buses
make seven trips each way, daily, between Knoxville and
Asheville, going through the park via Gatlinburg and
Cherokee. North Carolina towns bordering the park may
be reached by direct buses from Atlanta and Chattanooga.
Excursions by bus also may be made from Knoxville, stopping
overnight at Gatlinburg and continuing to Knoxville
via Maryville, Tenn. Smoky Mountain Tours, Inc., with
offices in both Knoxville and Asheville, operate personally
conducted sightseeing stages through the park between the
two cities frequently during the summer. The Southern
Railway offers both one-way and round-trip tickets, providing
travel by bus through the park between Knoxville and
Asheville.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Seasons">The Seasons</h2>
</div>


<p>Summer days are usually warm or hot in the lowland
areas and cool in the higher mountains; the nights are cool.</p>

<p>Spring arrives early in the lowland areas and progressively
later at higher elevations. Weather conditions are particularly
favorable in autumn, with less rainfall at that season.
Winters are variable, both as to severity and length, but
they normally are mild in the lowlands.</p>

<p>Rain, snow, and fog often are encountered in the mountains
during the winter. Roads are kept open all year, but
the transmountain highway sometimes is closed for a few
hours during heavy snow or sleet storms when snowplows
cannot keep it open. Snows are infrequent in the park,
but you should take chains if you plan to drive through
in winter. Roads are posted if driving conditions are
unfavorable.</p>

<p>In some of the towns bordering the park, horses and pack
animals, with guide service, may be rented by the hour, day,
or for longer periods.</p>

<h2>Roads and Trails</h2>

<p>There are 66 miles of high standard roads in the park
including the transmountain highway from Gatlinburg,
Tenn., to Cherokee, N. C. Clingmans Dome Highway
reaches an altitude of 6,311 feet. Seventy miles of secondary
roads and 653 miles of horse and foot trails are
available for hiking and riding.</p>

<p>The park highways offer exceptional opportunities to view
the grandeur of the Great Smokies. Spur roads and trails
lead to many points of interest.</p>

<p>There are trails of all types to suit your individual requirements.
Some are 4 feet wide on easy gradients; some are
improved footpaths; others merely tracks through the forest.
Park forces try to keep trails drained and clear of brush and
other obstacles; but the country is rough, and hikers should
wear suitable outdoor clothing, including stout low-heeled
shoes. If you are an inexperienced hiker, you should be
especially careful and watch your footing on the trails.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Appalachian_Trail">The Appalachian Trail</h2>
</div>


<p>The Appalachian Trail crosses the park and follows the
ridge of the Smokies for most of its 71 miles. The eastern
portion, from Davenport Gap at the northeast corner to
Newfound Gap on the transmountain highway, is 31 miles
long and follows through an absolute wilderness. The
western portion from Newfound Gap to Fontana Dam just
outside the park, is 40 miles long. Most of the trail is over
5,000 feet in elevation.</p>

<p>There are 7 trailside shelters and 3 trailside campsites
along the 71-mile section of the Appalachian Trail in this
park from Davenport Gap to Newfound Gap (31 miles)
and Newfound Gap to Fontana Dam (40 miles). These
are nearly equally spaced for 1-day hiking trips. Shelters
are closed on 3 sides and provide simple bunk accommodations
for 6 persons. A fireplace is in front and water is
available nearby. Use of the shelters is normally restricted
to 1 night. Camping is permitted along the trail only at
the above points and a camping permit for each trip is
required. (See page <a href="#Page_8">8</a>.) Because of the scarcity of fuel
at these sites, you are advised to carry primus-type stoves.
